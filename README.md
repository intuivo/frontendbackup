Frond End Back Up is a free and open source Web Front End Saver For Web Pages, Web Apps and Web Projects, developed by Jesus Alcaraz and licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3.

I created this project to save your Front End Work initially as a research project. Similar to HTTrack but not related. If you are looking for a Sprider like software then www.httrack.com is where you need to look. 

The initial phase is made in PHP and you can use this only. Right now is in Alpha so is very rought and the coding is still in the process of evolving. 

Help will be appreciated if you like to join this project. I build all the funcitions from the ground up. 

I have only tested this in PHP 5.4, but is so simple it can could be transported to older PHP's.
